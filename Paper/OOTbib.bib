We consider two main sources of inefficiency: underdiversification (\&quot;down\&quot;) and nonparticipation in risky asset markets (\&quot;out\&quot;). While a few households are very poorly diversified, most Swedish households outperform the Sharpe ratio of their domestic stock index through international diversification. Financially sophisticated households invest more efficiently but also more aggressively, and overall they incur higher return losses from underdiversification. The return cost of nonparticipation is smaller by almost one-half when we take account of the fact that nonparticipants would likely be inefficient investors. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamics of individual portfolios in a unique data set containing the disaggregated wealth of all households in Sweden. Between 1999 and 2002, we observe little aggregate rebalancing in the financial portfolio of participants. These patterns conceal strong household-level evidence of active rebalancing, which on average offsets about one-half of idiosyncratic passive variations in the risky asset share. Wealthy, educated investors with better diversified portfolios tend to rebalance more actively. We find some evidence that households rebalance toward a greater risky share as they become richer. We also study the decisions to trade individual assets. Households are more likely to fully sell directly held stocks if those stocks have performed well, and more likely to exit direct stockholding if their stock portfolios have performed well; but these relationships are much weaker for mutual funds, a pattern that is consistent with previous research on the disposition effect among direct stockholders and performance sensitivity among mutual fund investors. When households continue to hold individual assets, however, they rebalance both stocks and mutual funds to offset about one-sixth of the passive variations in individual asset shares. Households rebalance primarily by adjusting purchases of risky assets if their risky portfolios have performed poorly, and by adjusting both fund purchases and full sales of stocks if their risky portfolios have performed well. Finally, the tendency for households to fully sell winning stocks is weaker for wealthy investors with diversified portfolios of individual stocks.},

We find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon household consumption. This effect is consistently larger than the effect of stock market wealth upon consumption.},

	abstract = {Economic theory predicts that home ownership should have a negative effect on risk-taking in financial portfolios. However, empirical work has not found a strong relationship between housing and portfolios. We identify two reasons for the divergence between the theory and data. First, it is critical to distinguish between home equity wealth and mortgage debt, as they have opposite-signed effects on portfolio choice. Second, it is important to isolate variation in home equity and mortgage debt that is orthogonal to unobserved determinants of portfolios. We estimate a model that permits home equity and mortgage debt to have different effects on portfolio shares. We isolate plausibly exogenous variation in home equity and mortgages by using differences across housing markets in average house prices and housing supply elasticities as instruments. Using data for 60,000 households, we find that increases in property value (holding home equity constant) reduce stockholding significantly, while increases in home equity wealth (holding property value constant) raise stockholding. Our estimates imply that the stock share of liquid wealth would rise by 1 percentage point – 6\% of the mean stock share – if a household were to spend 10\% less on its house, holding fixed wealth. We conclude that housing has substantial impacts on portfolio choice, as theory predicts.}

Lucky squatters who end up with legal titles report beliefs closer to those that favor the workings of a free market. Examples include materialist and individualist beliefs (such as the belief that money is important for happiness or the belief that one can be successful without the support of a large group). The effects appear large. The value of a (generated) index of “market” beliefs is 20 percent higher for titled squatters than for untitled squatters, in spite of leading otherwise similar lives. Moreover, the effect is sufficiently large so as to make the beliefs of the squatters with legal titles broadly comparable to those of the general Buenos Aires population, in spite of the large differences in the lives they lead.},

On the societal level, homeowners are said to have higher rates of participation in voluntary organizations and local social interaction. The longitudinal research described in this article assesses the validity of these claims by comparing changes in self esteem, perceived control, life satisfaction and social interaction between a group of low-income home buyers and a demographically similar group of continuing renters. The results show that home ownership has a positive and significant impact on both the life satisfaction and participation in neighborhood and block association meetings.

This paper sets up a life-cycle portfolio choice model which generates this pattern of limited stock market participation.

In addition, the model replicates two salient features of the data. First, it replicates the U-shaped life-cycle profile of stock market participation among renters, which is due to sorting. Second, the crowding-out mechanism that leads to limited participation among home owners in the model is consistent with difference-in-difference regressions on a high-quality Swedish panel data set.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic  effects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of  this paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews  their effects on R\&D and economic growth. This part also discusses  the distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR  protection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent  rights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects  of IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions  from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments  have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical  evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection  and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries  than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR  protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation  against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.  Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level  of protection requires an international coordination (rather than  the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	year = 2010,
	type = {Working Papers},
	number = 201005,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the risk-return relationship in determination  of housing asset pricing. In so doing, the paper evaluates behavioral  hypotheses advanced by Case and Shiller (1988, 2002, 2009) in studies  of boom and post-boom housing markets. The paper specifies and tests  a housing asset pricing model (H-CAPM), whereby expected returns  of metropolitan-specific housing markets are equated to the market  return, as represented by aggregate US house price time-series. We  augment the model by examining the impact of additional risk factors  including aggregate stock market returns, idiosyncratic risk, momentum,  and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) size effects. Further, we  test the robustness of H-CAPM results to inclusion of controls for  socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price literature,  including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure incidence.  Consistent with the traditional CAPM, we find a sizable and statistically  significant influence of the market factor on MSA house price returns.  Moreover we show that market betas have varied substantially over  time. Also, we find the basic housing CAPM results are robust to  the inclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard  measures of risk and other housing market fundamentals. Additional  tests of the validity of the model using the Fama-MacBeth framework  offer further strong support of a positive risk and return relationship  in housing. Our findings are supportive of the application of a housing  investment risk-return framework in explanation of variation in metro-area  cross-section and time-series US house price returns. Further, results  strongly corroborate Case-Shiller behavioral research indicating  the importance of speculative forces in the determination of U.S.  housing returns.},
