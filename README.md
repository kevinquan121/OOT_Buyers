# Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare (Favilukis and Van Nieuwerburgh forthcoming)
This repository contains all the code files required to generate the tables and figures in the paper, Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare, forthcoming in the Journal of Finance. To quantify the welfare effects of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers, the paper develops an equilibrium model and calibrates the model to the typical U.S. metropolitan area. In the baseline model (Section 4 and 5 in the paper), the paper solves a heterogeneous agent model with two residential zones, city urban core and its periphery. The model consists of five sectors, households, construction firms in the two zones, consumption good firms, and out-of-twon home buyers.
